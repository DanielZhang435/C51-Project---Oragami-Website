                <p>Step 1) Start with a square sheet of paper with the white side up. 
                    Fold it in half horizontally and un then unfold.

                    Step 2) Fold the paper in half vertically.
                
                    Step 3) Fold the paper in half vertically again and then unfold it.
                     You’ll use this crease as a guide in later steps.
                    
                     Step 4) Fold the paper down along the dotted line.

                     Step 5) Crease this fold well and then unfold it
                    
                     Step 6) Fold the paper down along the dotted line.
                    
                     Step 7) Crease this fold well and then unfold it.
                    
                     Step 8) Turn the paper over.
                    
                     Step 9) Fold the paper down along the horizontal dotted line.
                    
                     Step 10) Crease this fold well and then unfold it.
                    
                     Step 11) Turn the paper back over to the way it was before.
                    
                     Step 12) Fold the paper down along the existing creases.
                    
                     Step 13) Push everything down flat.
                    
                     Step 14) Fold the bottom part of the paper up along the dotted line.
                    
                     Step 15) Fold the left side of the paper towards the centre along the dotted line.
                      Don’t fold that top triangle. 
                     The paper will tuck in behind it.
                    
                     Step 16) Fold the right side of the paper towards the centre along the dotted line.
                      Again, don’t fold the top triangle but tuck the paper in behind it.
                    
                      Step 17) Fold the bottom part of the paper up along the dotted line.
                    
                      Step 18) Fold the paper down along the dotted line.
                    
                      Step 19) Crease this fold well and then unfold it.
                    
                      Step 20) Fold the paper down along the dotted line.

                      Step 21) Crease this fold well and then unfold it.
                    
                      Step 22) Pull the two flaps of paper on the inside of either side out.
                    
                      Step 23) Fold the two flaps of paper on each side down along the dotted lines.
                    
                      Step 24) Fold the top right part of the paper up along the dotted line. 
                      This will make one of the frog’s front legs.
                       Don’t worry about the angle of the crease. 
                    
                       Step 25) Fold the left part of the paper up along the dotted line to make the other front leg.
                        It should match the other leg from the previous step.
                    
                        Step 26) Fold the bottom right part of the paper up along the dotted line.
                         This will form one of the back legs.

                         Step 27) Fold the bottom left part of the paper up along the dotted line to form the other back leg.
                        
                         Step 28) Fold the entire model up along the dotted line.
                        
                         Step 29) Fold the top part of the model down along the dotted line.
                        
                         Step 30) Turn the whole model over.</p>

                         Then repeat on the other side.
                        
                         Step 13) Inside Reverse Fold up both sides of the paper.
